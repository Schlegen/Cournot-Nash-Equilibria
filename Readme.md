# Reproduction of an article using Optimal Transport's theory

The aim of this project is to reproduct the results of the article "Computation of Cournot-Nash equilibria by entropic
regularization" by Adrien Blanchet, Guillaume Carlier, Luca Nenna. This article uses the entropic regularization method
to approximate a Nash-Cournot Equilibrium.
