Indicate your choice of project for validation using this form

Remember that in order to get a good grade: 
Each project requires reading and understanding at least a few articles.
Each project requires some coding (not only using some existing toolbox).
Each project requires an intense testing phase of the methods on your own data.

Information for the presentation: 
The deadline is strict.
The duration is 6 minutes (+3 minutes questions).
It is very short. You must use a chronometer to monitor your timing and be exactly on time.
You must make several rehearsals in front of friends. It is very important to make rehearsals. 
You must upload the slide in PDF using the link provided above. No Powerpoint, no Keynote please. You will not be using your own Laptop. 
If possible, I highly recommend you send the slides to me the day before (in PDF, and by mail if not too heavy), so that everything is already installed on my laptop.
If you want to do a real time demo or to show a video, prepare your own computer and bring it with you already switched on. 
Your audience is me, i.e. someone who already knows most of the method, but probably not all the details. It is like in a scientific conference in front of experts of your field. So be focussed, do not lose time on generality or trivial things. 
Do not prepare too many slides, 6 minutes is very short. 
I suggest a slideshow as follow:
Title / name
Presentation of the problem
Proposed methods
Theoretical analysis
Numerical findings
Critics
Conclusion / perspective

Information for the project report: 
If possible, write the report in english. 
Using Latex is highly recommended.
Roughly 15 pages (A4, 11pt font, single column), including roughly one page of bibliography.
Should be similar to a (short) scientific article in an applied mathematics journal. 
No source code. 
When presenting the numerics, give all parameters, so that the results are reproducible. 
It should not be a rewriting of the original article. You should only report about what you have done, and only explain the theory that is relevant to explain the numerics you have done.
It must contain at the end a section explaining the connexion with the course (see below).
Suggestion of structure for the report: 
Abstract (Â½ page): 
What problem(s) is studied ? 
Why is it relevant ? 
What solution(s) is proposed ? 
Which contributions (theory, numerics, etc) ? 


Introduction (~3 pages) : 
Presentation of the problem(s). 
Previous works (at least a few citations). If relevant, include things that you have seen during the MVA course (or possibly other courses).
Contributions. Why is the studied method different/better/worse/etc. than existing previous works.

Main body (~10 pages) : 
Presentation of the method(s). 
Theoretical guarantees. 
Numerics. 
Conclusion and perspective (~1 page)
Summary of the result obtained: pros and cons (limitation, problems, error in the articles, etc)
Possible improvement/extension
MANDATORY SECTION: Connexion with the course. What are the notions/results/algorithms presented in the course which are used or related to the one presented in this paper?
Bibliography (~1 page)
